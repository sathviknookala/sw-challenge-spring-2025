NOTE: sw_challenge_data_cleaning and sw_challenge_date_interface are the MAIN files for this project

For using the interface first download the cleaned_data folder onto your machine and identify the path. Change the path on your file so that it is the path on where it is used on
your local machine. Alternatively copy the path for a specific clean csv_file and run the program. Follow the instructions for inputs and you should see your OHLCV bar with all float
variables representing open price, high price, low price, close price, and volume. Time interval instructions are included in the program as well as instructions for end and start date. NOTE: This is not a finished product but my submission of the work I had prior to the deadline. There are multiple areas for improvement that I am currently exploring

Screenshots of outputs are included in this repo.
